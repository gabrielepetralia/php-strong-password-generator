PHP Strong Password Generator
===
## Description
Create a web page that allows users to generate a random password.

### Milestone 1
Create a form that allows users to enter the length of the password. Then this data will be used by a function to generate a password containing letters, capital letters, numbers and symbols.

### Milestone 2
When the code works properly move the functions into a new file "functions.php" that we will include on the main page.

### Milestone 3
Redirect the users to another page that will show the generated password using "$_SESSION".
